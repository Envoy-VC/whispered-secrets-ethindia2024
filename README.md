# Whispered Secrets

"Whispered Secrets" is a collaborative murder mystery game where human players and AI agents work together to solve a crime. The game integrates Coinbase's Agent Kit, allowing AI agents powered by LLMs to perform on-chain operations like staking and reward distribution. Players uncover clues, interact with AI-driven characters, and strategize to identify the killer. The project showcases the seamless integration of AI and blockchain in a dynamic, interactive experience.
